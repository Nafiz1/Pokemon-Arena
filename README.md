# Pokemon-Arena
A Pokemon arena game where the player chooses four Pokemon and then battles until they win or lose. They beat the Pokemon one at a time by going through a series of turn based battles where the player gets the option to attack, retreat, or pass. The turns are decided at random and the enemy Pokemon will be in a random order. The enemy can only attack or pass. If you beat every enemy Pokemon you win, and if you have no more remaining Pokemon to battle with you lose. All Pokemon are created from reading a text file containing the stats of the Pokemon and their attacks.
